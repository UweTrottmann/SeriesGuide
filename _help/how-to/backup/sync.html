<p>You can backup and sync using either SeriesGuide Cloud or <a href="{{ site.data.links.trakt }}">Trakt</a>. Each has its advantages and disadvantages. Which one you want to use depends on the devices and apps you use.</p>
<p class="title">SeriesGuide Cloud</p>
<p>Works best if you only use SeriesGuide on your devices. It supports backing up and syncing all SeriesGuide data:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Sync
    <ul>
      <li>Shows</li>
      <li>Lists</li>
      <li>Movies</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p class="title">Trakt</p>
<p>Works best if you use other apps connected to Trakt (for example <a href="{{ site.data.links.trakt }}apps">apps on iOS or a media center</a>) or the <a href="{{ site.data.links.trakt }}">Trakt website</a>. It supports:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Sync
    <ul>
      <li>Shows (excluding favorite/hidden state, skipped state)</li>
      <li>Movies (watchlist, collection, watched)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Display your and friends Trakt viewing history.</li>
  <li>Check-in (episodes and movies).</li>
  <li>Post comments.</li>
  <li>Rate shows, episodes and movies.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="badge badge-info">Note</span> Unlike with Cloud, shows are not added automatically and the Lists section is not synced. But you can quickly <a href="#library">access your Trakt show watchlist and watched and collected shows</a>.</p>
<p>Check-Ins are submitted immediately to Trakt. But only with the next sync are checked-in episodes and movies marked as watched within SeriesGuide.</p>

<p class="title">Setup</p>
<p>To connect to either service:</p>
<ol>
  <li>In the bottom bar, tap <strong>More</strong> <span class="material-symbols-outlined" aria-hidden="true">menu</span>.</li>
  <li>Tap either <strong>SeriesGuide Cloud</strong> or <strong>Trakt</strong>.</li>
  <li>Tap the sign in or connect button and complete the sign-in process.</li>
</ol>
<p><span class="badge badge-info">Note</span> You <strong>can be connected to both</strong> SeriesGuide Cloud and Trakt at the same time. Setting watched and collected, commenting, rating and more will still be sent to Trakt. However, <strong>check-in and sync with Trakt will be disabled</strong>. Changes on the Trakt website or other apps connected to Trakt will not download.</p>
<p><span class="badge badge-info">Note</span> <strong>You can always change your mind!</strong> First, disconnect both SeriesGuide Cloud and Trakt. Then, sign into only one of them. The data on your device will be merged with the existing data on the service.</p>
