<p><span class="emoji">ðŸš¨</span> <strong>Not recommended when using SeriesGuide Cloud or Trakt.</strong> Syncing with Cloud or Trakt may overwrite any restored backup. With SeriesGuide Cloud, you can delete your account before restoring the backup, then re-create it afterwards to upload only the restored data.</p>
<p>To restore your backup <strong>on another device</strong>, first transfer the created files to it. For example send yourself an email with the files attached, plug your device into a computer to access its storage or save the files to online storage.</p>
<p><span class="badge badge-info">Note</span> You can use a <a href="https://play.google.com/store/search?q=file+manager&amp;c=apps">file manager</a> app to view or copy the backup files.</p>
<p><span class="badge badge-info">Note</span> You can import data from another source as long as it uses the <a href="https://github.com/UweTrottmann/SeriesGuide/wiki/JSON-export-format">JSON format that SeriesGuide expects</a>. 
  Add some shows/lists/movies and create a backup, then just open the created JSON file to see an example with actual data.</p>
