title: Connect to Trakt
---

<ol>
    <li>Tap <strong>More</strong> <span class="material-symbols-outlined" aria-hidden="true">menu</span> > <strong>Trakt</strong>.</li>
    <li>Tap <strong>Connect</strong> and follow the on-screen instructions.</li>
</ol>

<p><span class="badge badge-info">Troubleshooting</span> If you can't connect (white screen, error message), Trakt may currently 
    be unreachable (see the <a href="{% link _help/fix/outage.html %}">status links for Trakt</a>). Please try again later.</p>

<p>If after signing in at Trakt your device does not go back to SeriesGuide, try to temporarily 
    <a href="https://support.google.com/android/answer/14324187">change the default browser</a> of your device.
    Chrome and Samsung Internet are known to work.</p>    

<p>Try to turn off any proxy or VPN (for example for ad blocking). Try to clear the SeriesGuide cache (in your device settings, in <strong>Apps</strong> find SeriesGuide, then in Storage tap <strong>Clear Cache</strong>).</p>
<p>When using a privacy tool (for example a Xposed module), make sure SeriesGuide has access to the Android account system. It needs an account to store your Trakt credentials and sync.</p>
<p>If your issue persists, please <a href="{% link _help/other/contact.html %}">contact me</a> about what is going wrong (send a screenshot if possible).</p>
