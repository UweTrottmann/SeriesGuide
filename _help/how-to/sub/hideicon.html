<p><strong><span class="emoji">â„¹</span> On Android 13 and newer, it is no longer possible to hide the 
    launcher icon (apparently malicious apps have been abusing this to hide from users).</strong></p>

<p>Launch the SeriesGuide X unlock app, then tap the button at the bottom to hide the launcher icon.
It may take a few seconds for the icon to disappear from your launcher. On some devices, 
it may be necessary to reboot the device.</p>

<p>To restore the icon, uninstall the SeriesGuide X app either from your devices Settings or the Play Store app.
Then install it again.</p>
