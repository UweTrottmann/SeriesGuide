<p><span class="emoji">ℹ️</span> The preview program is only available on Google Play, not on Amazon App Store.</p>

<p>Testing of and feedback for preview versions is appreciated, but if you are not comfortable dealing with these issues (like keeping a 
    <a href="{% link _help/how-to/backup/backup.html %}">backup</a>) maybe do not join.</p>

<p>To test preview versions of SeriesGuide <strong>join or leave the preview (also called beta) program</strong>:</p>

<ul>
    <li>visit <a href="{{ site.data.links.testing }}">the Play Store testing website</a>, or</li>
    <li>on your device look for the beta info box <a href="{{ site.data.links.play }}">on the SeriesGuide page</a> in the Play Store app.</li>
</ul>

<p>Follow the instructions there. After a few minutes an update to the latest preview version, if there is one available, should be available through the Play Store app.
    Or when leaving, future updates will only be final versions.</p>
