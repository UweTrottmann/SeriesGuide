  <li>Swipe to the Details tab.</li>
  <li>Tap the globe symbol.</li>
  <li>Choose a language.</li>
</ol>

<p>In <strong>More</strong> > <strong>Settings</strong> > <strong>Advanced</strong>
  you can set an <strong>Alternative Language</strong>. The alternative language
  will be used if no translation or poster in the language chosen for a particular
  show is available.</p>

<p><span class="emoji">ℹ️</span> If details in your language are missing, help 
  add them <a href="{% link _help/how-to/basics/sources.html %}">at the data source</a>.</p>

<p><span class="emoji">ℹ️</span> SeriesGuide adds a show in the language that 
  is currently set as the search language (using the globe symbol in the top app bar).
  You can override the language by tapping on a show to view its details, then
  changing the language using the globe symbol before tapping <strong>Add show</strong>.</p>
