<ul>
    <li><a href="{% link _help/how-to/trakt/checkins.html %}">Check in via Trakt</a> if you are watching right now. (<strong>Not available</strong> if SeriesGuide Cloud is connected.)</li>
    <li><b>Set watched</b> if you have watched this.</li>
    <li><b>Add to collection</b> if you purchased (DVD, Blu-Ray) or downloaded this.</li>
