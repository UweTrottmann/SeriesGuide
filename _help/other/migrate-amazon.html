title: "Transfer from the Amazon Appstore to the Google Play version"
---

<p><span class="emoji">ℹ️</span> Starting August 20, 2025 SeriesGuide on the 
Amazon Appstore will only be available to download and receive updates on Kindle
devices. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/mas/appstore/android/faq">Amazon
Appstore for Android devices is shutting down</a>.</p>

<p>To continue receiving updates to SeriesGuide, please download and transfer to
<a href="{{ site.data.links.play }}">the Google Play version</a>.</p>

<p>If you have an active subscription or have purchased X Pass in the past, 
please <a href="{% link _help/other/contact.html %}">send me an email</a> with
proof of purchase (for example download and attach the confirmation email you 
received from Amazon) and we will find a solution.</p>

<p>To transfer your shows, lists and movies:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you use SeriesGuide Cloud (requires an active subscription): sign 
  into Cloud in the Google Play version. Your shows, lists and movies should
  get restored.</li>
  <li>If you use Trakt or no account: <a href="{% link _help/how-to/backup/backup.html %}">create a backup using files</a> in the
  Amazon version and restore it in the Google Play version. Only then connect
  Trakt (if you had before).</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that any settings you have customized, like language or stream provider 
  filters, have to be transfered manually.</p>
