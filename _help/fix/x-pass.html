title: "Get or install SeriesGuide X Pass (one-time purchase)"
---

<p><span class="emoji">ℹ️</span> X Pass is currently not available for new users. See how to <a href="{% link whypay.html %}">unlock all features</a>.</p>

<p>If you have <strong>purchased the standalone SeriesGuide X key app</strong> in the past, make sure to sign in with the account that bought it in Play Store and <a href="{{ site.data.links.playx }}">follow this link</a>.</p>

<p>If you have <strong>purchased X Pass inside the app</strong> in the past, your purchase gets automatically restored. If that does not work, try the same <a href="{% link _help/fix/subs.html %}">troubleshooting steps as for subscriptions</a>.</p>

<p>I decided to remove the one-time purchase option as SeriesGuide has recurring costs (Cloud, my living costs) that can't be sustained with a purchase valid for a life-time. I may consider to add a one-time purchase option back that does not include access to Cloud. Your feedback on this is appreciated.</p>
