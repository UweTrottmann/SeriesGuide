<p>You may have moved SeriesGuide to the SD card/external storage. For SeriesGuide to work properly it <strong>has to be installed on your device/internal memory</strong>. Move it back and everything should be fine again (if not, <strong>try rebooting your device</strong>).</p>
<p>If that is not the case, it may help to <a href="{% link _help/fix/battery.html %}">exclude SeriesGuide from battery optimizations</a>.</p>
