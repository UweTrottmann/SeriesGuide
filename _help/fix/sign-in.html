<p>Especially if you are using multiple devices, it is possible that your Cloud account got automatically converted from email and password to Google account sign-in.</p>
<p>In that case your sign-in method can be reset, please <a href="{% link _help/other/contact.html %}">contact me</a> and make sure to include the email address.</p>
