title: Cancel, change or refund a subscription
---

<p>If you have subscribed through Google Play, 
you can <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/7018481">cancel, 
change or in some regions for a brief time ask for a refund</a> yourself.</p>

<p>You can also contact me to issue a refund. To do so, first find out the 
<strong>email address</strong> of the account used to complete the purchase, or
the <strong>order number</strong>. Then <a href="{% link _help/other/contact.html %}">
send them to me and ask for a refund</a>.</p>

<p><span class="emoji">ℹ️</span> For purchases on Google Play, you can find the
order number and invoice on <a href="https://payments.google.com/">the Google 
Payments website</a>. Make sure to sign in with the account that was used to
complete the purchase.</p>
