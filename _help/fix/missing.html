<p><strong>If the show is added to your library:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>From the <strong>Shows</strong> list, tap <strong>Filter shows</strong> <span class="material-symbols-outlined" aria-hidden="true">filter_list</span>.</li>
    <li>Check the Filter shows and Sort shows settings. A show might be not shown or shown at an unexpected position because of them.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>When trying to search for a show or movie:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>If search can't find a show, <a href="https://discuss.seriesgui.de/t/tips-for-searching-for-shows/67">try the tips post on the forum</a>.</li>
    <li>Also, sometimes a supposedly TV show is actually a series of movies and can be found under Movies.</li>
    <li>The same applies to movies, for example made for TV movies are found under Shows.</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyhow, all series and movie data is loaded from the user-created database at <a href="{{ site.data.links.tmdb }}">themoviedb.org</a></a>. Feel free to help out there to add missing information for all other users.</p>
