<p><span class="emoji">ℹ️</span> The show/episode release times are restricted to the <strong>original release</strong> in the country of origin.</p>
<p><span class="emoji">✅</span> If you want local listings and listings of re-broadcasts, please look for a suitable TV guide offering in your region.</p>
<p>If <strong>the release country is known</strong>, SeriesGuide assumes the release time is in a time zone of this country (for example Eastern Time for US shows, British Time for British shows, Central European Time for German shows, ...). Then it is <strong>converted to your device time zone</strong>.</p>
<p>If <strong>the release country is not known</strong>, SeriesGuide will assume the country to be the United States of America.</p>
<p>You can view the country in the detailed show information.</p>
<p><span class="emoji">ℹ️</span> If your device is <strong>set to a US mainland time zone</strong>, SeriesGuide will automatically adjust the release time (for example one hour earlier in Central Time).</p>
