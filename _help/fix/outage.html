<p><span class="emoji">ℹ️️</span> <strong>Since 2022-04-10, in Russia or Belarus</strong> it is currently not 
    possible to search for, add or update shows and movies in SeriesGuide.</p>

<p>This is because the data source SeriesGuide uses, <a href="{{ site.data.links.tmdb }}">TMDB</a>, 
is blocking access from IP addresses attributed to the Russia or Belarus region out of solidarity due to the ongoing war in Ukraine. 
    <a href="https://blog.themoviedb.org/the-movie-database-suspends-access-from-russia-and-belarus-b6a1a96fb35b">Read the TMDB statement.</a></p>

<hr>

<p><strong><span class="emoji">ℹ️️</span> Some countries or internet service providers (ISP) are known to block 
<a href="{{ site.data.links.tmdb }}">themoviedb.org</a> or <a href="{{ site.data.links.trakt }}">trakt.tv</a></strong>  
(like <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/talk/65d4b89ce640d6017dececac">in India</a>).
In this case it may be possible to use custom DNS servers, switch to another connection (different ISP) or use VPN software (at your own risk).</p>

<hr>

<p>If you receive this error there might be a temporary issue with either your internet connection 
or one of the services SeriesGuide uses.</p>

<p><strong>You can check the following to learn about ongoing issues and their status:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/talk">TMDB support forums</a> and <a href="https://status.themoviedb.org">TMDB Status page</a></li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/trakt">Trakt X account</a> and <a href="https://status.trakt.tv/">Trakt status page</a></li>
<li><a href="{{ site.data.links.x }}">SeriesGuide X account</a> or <a href="{{ site.data.links.community }}">announcements on the forum</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Keep in mind that TMDB, Trakt as well as SeriesGuide are services operated by a small or even one-person staff. 
If the service experiences issues, the person which can fix it can not always be available 
(it's night time, they are working another job or are on holiday). So it can take time until 
issues are resolved. Please do not expect 24/7 availability like from services that can 
afford a large, around the world support staff.</p>

<p><strong>So please be patient and try again later.</strong> If the issue persists after a few days, then please let me know about it.</p>

<p>Thank you for understanding!</p>
