<p>If you have an active subscription, but SeriesGuide does not recognize it, have a look at the <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/1050566">troubleshooting steps from Google Play Help</a>.</p>

<p>If you have multiple Google accounts, check that SeriesGuide was installed with the correct account active in the Play Store app.</p>
